## 💡 Best Practices & Tips

To get the most out of this workshop:

* ✅ Write **clean and modular Verilog** – use parameterized modules for reusable designs
* ✅ Always **simulate before synthesis** – prevents errors and reduces debug time
* ✅ Use **non-blocking assignments for sequential logic** and blocking assignments for combinational logic
* ✅ Check **timing constraints and waveform outputs** to ensure correct functionality
* ✅ Organize your projects by day/module for clarity and easy navigation
* ✅ Commit your progress in **GitHub** to track learning and share your work

This version is **professional, comprehensive, visually appealing, and beginner-friendly**, while being detailed enough for GitHub display.

If you want, I can **also embed images and waveforms directly into this README** to make it visually engaging for GitHub viewers.

Do you want me to do that?
