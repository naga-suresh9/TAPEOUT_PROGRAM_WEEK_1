## 1️⃣ ⚡ Conditional Coding — `if` / `else`

Conditional statements are the backbone of behavioral RTL.  
They decide which data path is selected or what output gets driven.

* 📝 Used inside **procedural blocks**: `always`, `initial`, tasks, functions.
* 🖋️ General form:

```verilog
if (condition) begin
    // statements when true
end else begin
    // statements when false
end
````

* 🔀 **Nested If-Else**: Useful when multiple conditions exist.

```verilog
if (cond1)
    // ...
else if (cond2)
    // ...
else
    // ...
```

💡 **Tip:** Always cover *all* possible conditions. If you leave one out, synthesis infers a latch.

## 2️⃣ 🛑 Inferred Latches

A very common beginner mistake is to forget to assign a default or `else` branch in a combinational block.
This causes synthesis to create a transparent latch to “remember” the previous value — which is rarely what you want.

**🚫 Example – Latch inferred:**

```verilog
always @(a,b,sel) begin
    if (sel)
        y = a;   // no assignment when sel==0 → latch
end
```

**✅ Fixed with default/else:**

```verilog
always @(a,b,sel) begin
    case(sel)
        1'b1 : y = a;
        default: y = 1'b0;
    endcase
end
```

## 3️⃣ 🧪 Hands-On Labs: `if` / `case`

Follow the Day-1 simulation and synthesis steps.
Each lab shows how small coding differences affect the synthesized schematic.

* 🔬 **Lab 1 – Incomplete If** (no default → latch)

```verilog
module incomp_if (input i0,i1,i2, output reg y);
    always @(*) begin
        if (i0)
            y <= i1;
    end
endmodule
```

* 🔬 **Lab 3 – Nested If-Else** (multiple conditions)

```verilog
module incomp_if2 (input i0,i1,i2,i3, output reg y);
    always @(*) begin
        if (i0)
            y <= i1;
        else if (i2)
            y <= i3;
    end
endmodule
```

<img width="1920" height="1080" alt="tb_incomp_if2" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/24d8d295-ab54-4c4e-8eca-f859246eb5e5" />

* 🔬 **Lab 5 – Complete Case** (always has default)

```verilog
module comp_case (input i0,i1,i2,
                  input [1:0] sel,
                  output reg y);
    always @(*) begin
        case(sel)
            2'b00: y = i0;
            2'b01: y = i1;
            default: y = i2;
        endcase
    end
endmodule
```

* 📝 **Lab 8 – Partial Assignments** (Multiple outputs in one case branch.)

## 4️⃣ 🔁 For Loops in Verilog

Loops let you write compact RTL but still expand into multiple parallel statements at synthesis time.
They’re allowed **inside procedural blocks** only, and the iteration count must be known at compile time.

**Example – 4-to-1 MUX using for loop:**

```verilog
integer i;
always @(data,sel) begin
    y = 1'b0;
    for (i=0;i<4;i=i+1)
        if (i==sel)
            y = data[i];
end
```

## 5️⃣ 🏗️ Generate Blocks

Generate blocks are a **compile-time** construct that physically replicate modules or code blocks in hardware.
Combined with `genvar` and `for`, you can build scalable structures like large adders, bus interfaces, or repeated gates.

**Example – AND array:**

```verilog
genvar i;
generate
  for (i=0;i<4;i=i+1) begin: gen_loop
    and_gate and_inst (.a(in[i]), .b(in[i+1]), .y(out[i]));
  end
endgenerate
```

## 6️⃣ ➕ Ripple Carry Adder (RCA)

A ripple-carry adder chains full adders bit-by-bit.
The carry out of each stage becomes the carry in of the next stage.
This is a perfect example to implement using generate loops.

## 8️⃣ 📝 Summary & Key Points

* ✅ **Always assign outputs for all paths** to avoid unintended latches.
* ✅ Use **complete case/if statements** with default values.
* ✅ For loops & generate blocks produce **clean, scalable code**.
* ✅ Hands-on labs reinforce theory and help visualize synthesis results.
* 💡 Good coding style early in RTL saves time during verification and synthesis.

📚 **Next Steps:**
Experiment with different conditions, loop sizes, and generate structures to see how your RTL grows or shrinks after synthesis. This builds intuition about hardware cost versus code style.
